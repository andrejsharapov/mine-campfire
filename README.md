## How it works?

## How to update to the latest version?

We try to update the package version in a timely manner, but if you see that the game version has changed, you can update the package yourself.

1. Unzip `mctpms-campfire.zip` file with textures;
2. Find and open `pack.mcmeta` through text editor;
3. Change `pack_format` to the [latest version](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Pack_format#List_of_resource_pack_formats) of the game.

```js
{
  "pack": {
    "pack_format": 46,
  }
}
```
